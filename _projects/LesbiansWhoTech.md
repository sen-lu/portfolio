# Lesbians Who Tech

[Lesbians Who Tech][2] is a community of queer women in and around tech who are working to diversify STEM and build inclusive networks.

I was invited to lead a **Social Good Hackathon** project at the [2017 New York Summit][3], which congregated 2,000+ queer women and allies across various sectors of technology. Alongside other members of the [AsylumConnect][4] team, we guided a diverse team of software engineers, UX designers, journalists, and nonprofit administrators through the following prompt:

> **Empower persecuted queer populations to seek asylum in the U.S.**
>
> Thousands â€‹of LGBTQ immigrants and asylum seekers come to the U.S. every year, fleeing persecution based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Yet even upon arrival, they often struggle to meet fundamental human needs. AsylumConnect is a nonprofit that helps queer asylum seekers find lifesaving resources. Help us ideate ways to better serve our population, from amplifying their voices to safely integrating into local communities.

This team placed second at the hackathon with their proposal for helping queer asylum seekers build a sense of security and community.

## Process

We kicked off with a presentation on the plight of LGBTQ asylum seekers, examples of specific population needs, and a short history of AsylumConnect and our product's evolution. Our team then walked attendees through prepared questions based on our organization's identified challenges:

- How can we promote queer asylum seekers' confidence and sense of security when accessing services?
- How can we better help queer asylum seekers in the entirety of their journey, from planning for their arrival in the States to safely integrating into local communities?
- How can we amplify the voices of queer asylum seekers to improve visibility, enable community information-sharing, and/or inform future initiatives?
- How can we help service providers better understand and serve LGBTQ asylum seekers?
