# Lesbians Who Tech

[Lesbians Who Tech][2] is a community of queer women in and around tech who are working to diversify STEM and build inclusive networks.

## Social Good Hackathon

As [AsylumConnect][4]'s Director of Technology, I was invited to lead a **Social Good Hackathon** project at the [2017 New York Summit][3]. The conference brought together 2,000+ queer women and allies across various sectors of technology. The AsylumConnect team was excited by this opportunity to build civic technology capacity by guiding a diverse team of software engineers, UX designers, journalists, and nonprofit administrators through the following prompt:

> **Empower persecuted queer populations to seek asylum in the U.S.**
>
> Thousands â€‹of LGBTQ immigrants and asylum seekers come to the U.S. every year, fleeing persecution based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Yet even upon arrival, they often struggle to meet fundamental human needs. AsylumConnect is a nonprofit that helps queer asylum seekers find lifesaving resources. Help us ideate ways to better serve our population, from amplifying their voices to safely integrating into local communities.

### Process

We kicked off with a presentation on the plight of LGBTQ asylum seekers, examples of specific population needs, and a short history of AsylumConnect and our product's evolution. Our team then walked attendees through prepared questions based on organizationally identified challenges:

#### Challenge Questions

- How can we promote queer asylum seekers' confidence and sense of security when accessing services?
- How can we better help queer asylum seekers in the entirety of their journey, from planning for their arrival in the States to safely integrating into local communities?
- How can we amplify the voices of queer asylum seekers to improve visibility, enable community information-sharing, and/or inform future initiatives?
- How can we help service providers better understand and serve LGBTQ asylum seekers?

#### Collaborative Brainstorming

The idea generation process resulted in several exciting concepts, many of which we've since incorporated into the AsylumConnect roadmap.

![Brainstorming][7]

Examples:
- Making service provider ratings and reviews as granular as possible, such as by providing optional reviewer demographics so users can better intuit whether or not a given rating would be applicable to them. For example, a trans woman may feel more comfortable accessing a resource if another trans woman has rated the resource positively.
- An option to toggle on "covert" UI for queer asylum seekers who may not feel comfortable with rainbow branding (e.g., using public computers in spaces that are not LGBTQ-friendly).
- Low barrier to entry for features that traditionally require user accounts. This expands product access for a population that often holds serious information security concerns. For example, while pinning "favorite" providers requires an account to track saved resources across sessions, the AsylumConnect catalog could use local web storage to temporarily save resources within a single catalog session, or even across anonymous sessions.

### Product

The volunteer team ultimately chose to tackle a combination of the first three Challenge Questions with **AsylumConnect Community**, a social extension to the existing AsylumConnect resource catalog. This product aimed to provide a more holistic sense of psychological safety around the asylum seeking experience.

![Search][6]

The team redesigned the AsylumConnect catalog homepage to include the following features:
- "Ask a Lawyer" forum to support queer asylum seekers through the asylum application process
- "City Overviews" to help queer asylum seekers pick a city for their arrival in the U.S. (e.g., access to public transportation, average housing prices, Muslim-friendliness)
- "Success Stories" from integrated asylees that can provide guidance and encouragement for current asylum seekers
- "Community Forum" for asking questions and sharing advice

### Summary

In addition to placing second, the AsylumConnect-led hackathon team generated ideas that will continue shape our organizational vision. Shoutout to Lesbians Who Tech for building out such great opportunities for collaboration!
