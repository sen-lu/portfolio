# ![][10] Lesbians Who Tech
### September 2017
#### Hackathon Lead

[Lesbians Who Tech][2] is a community of queer women in and around tech who are working to diversify STEM and build inclusive networks.

## Social Good Hackathon

The 4th Annual [Lesbians Who Tech + Allies Summit][3] from September 7th-9th, 2017 in New York City brought together over 2,000 lesbians, queer women + allies across all areas of technology.

As [AsylumConnect][4]'s Director of Technology, I was invited to lead a project at the summit's day-long **Social Good Hackathon**. Our team guided software engineers, UX designers, journalists, students, and nonprofit administrators through this prompt:

> **Empower persecuted queer populations to seek asylum in the U.S.**
>
> Thousands â€‹of LGBTQ immigrants and asylum seekers come to the U.S. every year, fleeing persecution based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Yet even upon arrival, they often struggle to meet fundamental human needs. AsylumConnect is a nonprofit that helps queer asylum seekers find lifesaving resources. Help us ideate ways to better serve our population, from amplifying their voices to safely integrating into local communities.

We educated hackathon attendees about the plight of LGBTQ asylum seekers in the United States, led a collective brainstorming session around organizationally identified challenges, and facilitated the hackathon team in building their project.

The team we led placed second with **AsylumConnect Community**, a social extension to the [AsylumConnect resource catalog][9] that aimed to provide asylum seekers with a sense of psychological safety, security, and community.
