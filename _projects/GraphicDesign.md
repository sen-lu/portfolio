# Graphic Design

### Personal Logo

During a 2012 Graphic Design class at the University of Pennsylvania, I was tasked with creating a personal logo. I first collected **external inspiration**:

Then conducted **internal reflection**:

I integrated this inspiration with my initials (TL) to make the following shape:

While it conveyed the clean, bold aesthetic and sense of movement I was aiming for, it lacked grounding and was too sharp and static. I wanted to impart a sense of continuity, a shape that existed both in and outside of itself. My final product is the personal logo I still use today:

### Font Design

Inspired by a Victorian townhouse on South Street, Philadelphia, PA, ZONING is an architectural font that remains true to its late seventeenth century root Queen Anne values of picturesque coherence and informality. The Aesthetic Movement of the 1890s, which revitalized Philadelphian townhouse design, is apparent in the font’s thinned architectural lines, relative unornamentation, and balanced asymmetries. Form follows function with the lettering’s stacking and gridding capacity: ZONING’s wide range of applicability runs the gamut from  modernized subway design to children’s educational television.
